# üîÄ Jumble.nvim

Say goodbye to tedious manual theme changes! With this plugin, your theme will automatically update to a random theme at a specified time interval.

- **Choose Your interval**: Set how often you want your theme to refresh (e.g., every day, every other week)

- **Random Themes**: Set your theme randomly after the set time interval. Choose from a list of themes you provide or from all the themes installed
